For this project, you simply need to make a small JavaScript project that makes an HTTP request to one of these APIs and shows the data in some way, whether it is text or images, or anything else. 


How to get started:

2. Find the base URL and endpoint(s) that you want to use to get your data
3. Create your `fetch` request using the URL and the API token as the documentation tells you
4. Use document DOM methods like `appendChild` and/or `createElement` to display your data on the page. You can do this either on page load or a button click, or any other trigger you want to use
5. Add a little styling to make it easy to look at if it needs it

Use of this API does not require a API Key, just generate the URL below use it in your own application to retrieve trivia questions.
